              delivering high quality web experiences in Fintech and Logistics.
              In the past, I have worked on various projects as a freelancer in
              India in collaboration with a number of startups who required
              clean websites, dynamic web applications, and simple portfolio
              websites.

              An interest in FinTech took me to the USA, where I pursued
              Financial Engineering and had the opportunity to work as a Senior
              Developer at a globally reputed investment bank in New York City.

              currently work as a Senior Frontend Engineer.
