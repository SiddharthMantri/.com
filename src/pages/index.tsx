              I am a 28 year old, Madrid-based Software Engineer. In the past, I
              have worked on various projects as a freelancer in India in
              collaboration with a number of startups who required clean
              websites, dynamic web applications, and simple portfolio websites.

              An interest in FinTech took me to the USA, where I pursued
              Financial Engineering and had the opportunity to work as a Senior
              Developer at a globally reputed investment bank in New York City.

              Eventually, the irresistible appeal of beaches, temperate climate,
              and traveling through Europe, brought me to Spain, where I
              currently work as a Senior Frontend Engineer.

              Over the years, I have been fortunate to have worked with
              extremely talented engineers and designers, enabling me to gather
              valuable experience that has helped me consistently sharpen my
              skills and become a better professional.

              When Iâ€™m not working on technology or design, you can find me
              playing video games and guitar, or wandering off to explore
              intriguing new places.
