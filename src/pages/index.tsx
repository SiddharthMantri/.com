              I am a 28 year old, Madrid-based Software Engineer working on
              delivering high quality web experiences in Fintech and Logistics.
              In the past, I have worked on various projects as a freelancer in
              India in collaboration with a number of startups who required
              clean websites, dynamic web applications, and simple portfolio
              websites.

              An interest in FinTech took me to the USA, where I pursued
              Financial Engineering and had the opportunity to work as a Senior
              Developer at a globally reputed investment bank in New York City.

              Eventually, the irresistible appeal of beaches, temperate climate,
              and traveling through Europe, brought me to Spain, where I
              currently work as a Senior Frontend Engineer.

              Over the years, I have been fortunate to have worked with
              extremely talented engineers and designers, enabling me to gather
              valuable experience that has helped me consistently sharpen my
              skills and become a better professional.
