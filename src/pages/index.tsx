            I am a 28 year old, Madrid/Almeria-based Software Engineer working
            on delivering high quality web experiences in Fintech and Logistics.
            In the past, I have worked on various projects as a freelancer in
            India in collaboration with a number of startups who required clean
            websites, dynamic web applications, and simple portfolio websites.

            An interest in FinTech took me to the USA, where I pursued Financial
            Engineering and had the opportunity to work as a Senior Developer at
            a globally reputed investment bank in New York City.

            Eventually, the irresistible appeal of beaches, temperate climate,
            and traveling through Europe, brought me to Spain, where I currently
            work as a Senior Frontend Engineer and freelance travel photgrapher.
